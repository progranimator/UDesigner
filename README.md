# UDesigner
UDesigner accelerates the creation of ENUMs, UFUNCTIONs, and USTRUCTs by providing the user with a UI to enter their variable names and variable types along with the title of the UFUNCTION or USTRUCT.
IF only UPROPERTY values are desired, then the user can simply follow the creation steps for a USTRUCT and pull the information in-between the USTRUCT for their required UPROPERTY information.
